## Folder 'midi-lstm-gan' is the final code we use!

## About this code
We implemented a C-GAN from scratch based on the [blog](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-conditional-generative-adversarial-network-from-scratch/)
In this GAN, we used a normal LSTM model for generator/discriminator.
We ported this code to the 'midi-lstm-gan' later, which used a Bi-directional LSTM model.
