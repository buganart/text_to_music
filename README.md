# CS230 Project: Automatic music composition from text


## Datasets

## Text to sentimemts

## Sentiments to music 

## Generator

### GANSynth

GANSynth is an algorithm for synthesizing audio with generative adversarial networks.
The details can be found in the [ICLR 2019 Paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1xQVn09FX). It achieves better audio quality than a standard WaveNet baselines on the [NSynth Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth), and synthesizes audio thousands of times faster.
